## Overview

This is a demo web application showcasing a full-stack Django project for creating multilingual emergency medical cards for people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivities. The application demonstrates my ability to build practical, user-centered web applications that solve real-world problems.




## Key Features

- **Multilingual Emergency Cards**: Create one card, access it in six languages
- **QR Code Sharing**: Easy sharing of cards with restaurants and medical staff
- **Printable Cards**: Download as PDF for offline use
- **Travel Guides**: Country-specific dining tips and phrases (Premium)
- **Sage AI Assistant**: Get personalized gluten-free advice powered by Claude AI (Premium)

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented a unified card management system with real-time preview
- Created a responsive, mobile-first UI with TailwindCSS
- Used Django's template system with template inheritance for maintainable code
- Implemented form handling with client-side validation
- Set up a clean URL structure with proper namespacing

## Development Approach

This project follows modern Django best practices:

- Modular app structure with clear separation of concerns
- Class-based views and form handling
- REST API endpoints for subscription management
- Custom middleware for premium content access control
- Interactive onboarding experience for new users
