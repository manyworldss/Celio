# Celio

Celio is an app I made because I needed something like it and couldn’t find it anywhere. I have celiac disease, and when I travel, it’s hard to explain what that means especially in a different language. It gets exhausting fast. Sometimes scary.

This tool creates a downloadable card that explains your condition in multiple languages so you can stay safe, eat with confidence, and not have to explain your whole medical history every time you sit down at a table.

---

### What it does

- Translates celiac safety info into 6+ languages
- Generates an emergency card you can save or print
- Doesn’t need an account or any login
- Works on your phone or laptop

---

### Why I built it

I wanted something that felt simple and reliable. No friction, no nonsense. Just a way to say what you need to say when it matters. This is for people who’ve had to Google-Translate their diagnosis and still felt misunderstood. I’ve been there.

---

### How it works

- Django 5 for the backend
- Tailwind CSS + HTMX for the frontend
- Docker + Railway for deployment
- Mobile-first layout
- Accessibility was baked into the design process from day one

---

### What I learned

This project taught me a lot about edge cases, health tech, and designing for clarity under stress. I interviewed other celiac travelers and paid attention to what scared them the most. Celio is what came out of that.
